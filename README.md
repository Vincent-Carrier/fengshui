Fengshui is a set of [fish]() functions for [sway]().

- `sway-focus-first` focuses the first tab in a tabbed container.
- `sway-focus-last` focuses the last tab in a tabbed container.
- `sway-focus-lock` prevents new windows from the current application from gaining focus. You can turn it off by reloading your config.
- `sway-focused` returns the info about the focused window.
- `sway-here` sends a `swaymsg` command to the calling terminal window.
- `sway-jump` creates EasyMotion-style labels for quick navigation.
- `sway-query` gives a convenient wrapper around `swaymsg` and `jq`.
- `sway-sub` lets you subscribe to IPC events.
- `sway-opacity` makes unfocused windows slightly transparent.
